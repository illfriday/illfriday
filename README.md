### Hi there 👋

<!--
**illfriday/illfriday** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio site/blog to write about my learning journey in web development. I plan to utilize 11ty static site generator, Hexo, and IndieWeb for this project. Might delete later.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript and Remix.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting, beginner open source projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with creating a blog within the IndieWeb sphere that incorporates webmentions. Hexo. Headless CMS(tried Strapi so far might look into Ghost).
- 💬 Ask me about hot sauce.
- 📫 How to reach me: willprouty@gmail.com
